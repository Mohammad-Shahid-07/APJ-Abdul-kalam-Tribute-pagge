          Madras Institute of Technology. Dr. Kalam made significant
          contribution as Project Director to develop India's first indigenous
          Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV-III) which successfully injected the
          Rohini satellite in the near earth orbit in July 1980 and made India
          an exclusive member of Space Club. He was responsible for the
          evolution of ISRO's launch vehicle programme, particularly the PSLV
